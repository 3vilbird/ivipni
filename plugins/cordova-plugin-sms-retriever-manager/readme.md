You can fine working Demo for Ionic 4 here: https://github.com/hanatharesh2712/sms-plugin-test

  Typescript (Ionic 4)
```typescript
  import { SmsRetriever } from '@ionic-native/sms-retriever/ngx';
 
 
  constructor(private smsRetriever: SmsRetriever) { }
 
  ...
 
 // This function is to get hash string of APP.
 // * @return {Promise<string>} Returns a promise that resolves when successfully generate hash of APP.
  this.smsRetriever.getAppHash()
    .then((res: any) => console.log(res))
    .catch((error: any) => console.error(error));


// * This function start wathching message arrive event and retrive message text.
// * @return {Promise<string>} Returns a promise that resolves when retrives SMS text or TIMEOUT after 5 min.
   this.smsRetriever.startWatching()

  ```

You can fine working Demo for Ionic 3 here: https://github.com/hanatharesh2712/sms-plugin-test-ionic-3

  Typescript (Ionic 3)

import { SmsRetriever } from '@ionic-native/sms-retriever/ngx';
var smsRetriever = window['cordova']['plugins']['smsRetriever'];
 
  public smsTextmessage: string = '';
  public appHashString: string = '';
  constructor(private smsRetriever: SmsRetriever) { }
 
  ...
 
  getHashCode() {
    smsRetriever['getAppHash']((res) => {
      this.appHashString = res;
      console.log(res);
    }, (err) => {
      console.warn(err);
    }
    );
  }

  getSMS() {
    smsRetriever['startWatching']((res) => {
      this.smsTextmessage = res.Message;
      console.log(res);
    }, (err) => {
      console.warn(err);
    }
    );
  }
  ```

You need to send your application hash in SMS when you are sending from your backend. to generate the hash of your application read this: https://developers.google.com/identity/sms-retriever/verify

To get your application hash code:

* Without the correct hash, your app won't recieve the message callback. This only needs to be
* generated once per app and stored. Then you can remove this function from your code.




BUILD FAILED

The problem is that you need to make sure that you set the target to android-19 or later in your ./platforms/android/project.properties file like this:

    # Project target.
    target=android-19


## Donations

If your app is successful or if you are working for a company, please consider donating some beer money :beer::

Keep in mind that I am maintaining this repository on my free time so thank you for considering a donation. :+1:


## Contributing

I believe that everything is working, feel free to put in an issue or to fork and make pull requests if you want to add a new feature.

Things you can fix:
* Allow for null number to be passed in
  Right now, it breaks when a null value is passed in for a number, but it works if it's a blank string, and allows the user to pick the number
  It should automatically convert a  null value to an empty string

Thanks for considering contributing to this project.

### Finding something to do

Ask, or pick an issue and comment on it announcing your desire to work on it. Ideally wait until we assign it to you to minimize work duplication.

### Reporting an issue

- Search existing issues before raising a new one.

- Include as much detail as possible.

### Pull requests

- Make it clear in the issue tracker what you are working on, so that someone else doesn't duplicate the work.

- Use a feature branch, not master.

- Rebase your feature branch onto origin/master before raising the PR.

- Keep up to date with changes in master so your PR is easy to merge.

- Be descriptive in your PR message: what is it for, why is it needed, etc.

- Make sure the tests pass

- Squash related commits as much as possible.

### Coding style

- Try to match the existing indent style.

- Don't mix platform-specific stuff into the main code.
